/*Questions

	True or false?
		a) more than one thread can be executed on a single core processor.
		b) only four threads can be executed on a quad core processor.
		c) when there are more threads than cores, the instructions for the processor cores are scheduled.
		d) on a single core processor only one instruction can be executed at the same time. So there is only an "illusional" simultanity. 
		e) "Race condition" is something that we want to achieve.
		f) "Race condition" describes possible malbehavior that occurs when two threads access the same shared data.
		g) A "delegate" in C# is the address to a method.
		h) In C# Forms Applications, the standard functionality does not require the use of delegates.
		i) We use delegates in C# Forms Applications, when we want to add a method with custom parameters to the eventhandler.

	Explain. What is?
		a) Thread Pooling
		b) Locking and deadlocks
		c) Mutex
		d) Semaphore
		
	Can you?
		a) in C# forms: add an event handler using a delegate?
		b) in C#: create a custom event?
		c) create a multithread application that accesses shared data (avoiding deadlocks and racing condition)
