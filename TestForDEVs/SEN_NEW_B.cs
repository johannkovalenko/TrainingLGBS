// Would you use an Interface, an Abstract Class, or a method with parameters?
// Produce sample code for case 2, 3 and 5

// 1) You have a program that reads out important invoice data. Unfortuneatly, every customer has a completely different looking PDF, so the task is the same for all customers, but the logic of getting the data differs 100%

// 2) Renault and Nissan have a strategic partnership. Their cars have the same chassis (podwozie) but every company has a different bodywork (nadwozie). 

// 3) You have a task for different customers. The logic differs completely per customer, but you want to assure that the same complex nested data structure is used in every concrete class.

// 4) You create an abstract factory.

// 5) You create an AI program that analyzes the story lines of 100 masterpieces of literature (Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz, War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Faust by Johann W. Goethe, Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, The Lusiads by Luis de Camoes, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, Les Miserables by Victor Hugo)
