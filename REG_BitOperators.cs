// Let's suppose that we have very limited hard disc capacities. Therefore we want to use the memory more efficiently.

// Our first candidate are birth dates. They are saved as DateTime, which is of type "double" (48 or 64 bits, not sure)
// Write an algorithm, that allows us to write the birthday of a person into the type "short" (16 bits)
// And a second algorithm, which reads the date and displays it correctly.
