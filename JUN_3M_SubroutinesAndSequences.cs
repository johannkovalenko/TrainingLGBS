/* Questions

	True or false?
		a) Methods should not be longer than 20 lines.
		b) Parameters pass runtime data from one class or method to another.
		c) In VBA: "sub" returns a value, and "function" returns no value
		d) "void MyMethod()" in C# is the equivalent of "sub MyMethod()" in VBA
		e) in VBA we use the term "function", and in C# the term "method". Both mean the same

	What is the best approach when we want to return more than one value (of different types)
		a) define the variable at class level, so that no parameters and return values are needed.
		b) convert all values to string, join them with a delimiter and return the joined string
		c) add all values to a non-generic list (without strong type) and return the list
		d) define all values without type, add all values to a non-generic list and return the list
		e) define your custom class, create an instance of it and return the instance
